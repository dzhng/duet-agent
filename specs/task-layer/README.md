# Task layer — subagents as tool calls, background tasks, quiescent terminals

Everything asynchronous becomes a **task**: tool calls, subagents (new `spawn_agent` tool),
and scheduled waits. Foreground calls race a wait budget (default 120s) then convert to a
"still running" tool result while the work continues — timeout is a nudge, never a kill.
`run_in_background` returns immediately. `task_output`/`task_stop` manage live tasks. The
turn-runner turn ends **only at quiescence**: any in-process task → no terminal (turn open,
VM awake); only wall-clock-scheduled work → `sleep`; nothing → `complete`. **Terminal means
terminal** — over RPC the process is reaped at the first one. `StateMachineController`
dissolves into `TaskManager` + `StateMachineDecisions` + one loop. New `park` state kind;
`ask_user_question` is parent-only. Hard cutover: no compat shims, no migrations (pre-users).

Planning record: `unknowns-map.md` (binding decision ledger + LM-\* landmine cards).
Line refs there are vs 3adf0df; drift as of ddfc6f2 is small but re-verify before pasting.

## Next Agent Prompt

**Status:** THE CUTOVER IS MERGED. `StateMachineController` is deleted; `TurnRunner`'s
`runTurnLoop` owns the turn with a single try/finally terminal exit derived from
`taskManager.pendingWork()`; parent-slot queue (`ParentLoopInput`) arbitrates passes;
control capture asserts; interrupt emits its own terminal (SIGTERM→SIGKILL via
`escalateStop`). Post-review fixes landed: ask gate (ask held while work is open),
`discardStaleTaskSettlements()` at every exit, ignored-settlement metadata release.
Landed: 01-07. Full docker suite 1092/0. Task-event EMISSION is still absent (slice 08).
Known gap: kernel additions `escalateStop`/`nextTaskId()` lack dedicated task-manager unit
tests — fold into slice 08. Last updated 2026-07-19.

You are implementing this spec. Read this README fully, then `unknowns-map.md` Quadrant 2
(binding decisions — do not relitigate) and the LM-\* cards for your slice. Work one slice at
a time from `slices/`, in dependency order. **Pickup point: slice 08.**

Per pass: follow [implement-spec](../../.claude/skills/implement-spec/SKILL.md) discipline —
implement, verify the slice's gate (red/green; live evals per
[write-eval](../../.claude/skills/write-eval/SKILL.md) with falsification), run
/code-review on the diff, commit, then update this section (status, pickup point, checklist)
before ending your pass. Workflow: Opus subagents implement, main agent reviews.

**Blockers/warnings:** none.

01–06 are preparation: 01/02 prove mechanics and build test seams; 03/04 add the new
libraries; 05/06 are behavior-preserving extractions that shrink 07. 07 is the pivot —
controller deleted, existing suite green **unmodified**. 08 ships the feature on bash;
09–13 extend it; 14 closes the done-gate.

## Module graph — one owner per concept

```
src/tasks/                    NEW, zero-dependency library (no pi, no app imports)
  task-manager.ts             task lifecycle, budget race, settlement FIFO, scopes, buffers
  quiescence.ts               computePendingWork() — the ONLY code that decides a terminal kind
  types.ts                    TaskId, TaskDescriptor, TaskSettlement — the ONE task shape
                              (protocol, persistence, TUI all reuse it; no mirror types)
src/turn-runner/
  runtime-clock.ts            NEW — the one owner of Date.now/setTimeout for task+schedule paths
  subagent.ts                 NEW — SubagentSpec + createSubagentExecutor; the ONLY way any
                              subagent is constructed (agent states + spawn_agent = spec builders)
  state-machine-decisions.ts  NEW — pure ledger/planner over state-machine-session.ts helpers
  task-tools.ts               NEW — spawn_agent, task_output, task_stop, budget wrapper; the one
                              formatter each for "still running" / settlement wordings
  turn-runner.ts              the one loop, parent-slot queue, control-capture asserting queue,
                              single-exit terminal emission, interrupt; only module that
                              constructs Agents and emits TurnEvents
  state-machine-controller.ts DELETED in slice 07 (no facade, no re-export shim)
  shell-state-handle.ts       shell exec + process-group kill template (reaper reuses it)
```

Import firewall: `src/tasks/*` imports nothing from the app or pi. `subagent.ts` may import
classifier/resolve but never the `ModelRouter` class. `state-machine-decisions.ts` never
imports TaskManager, Agent, or executors. `session/*` and `tui/*` see tasks only through
protocol types/events. Only `quiescence.ts` decides terminals; only the loop's single exit
emits them; only TaskManager settles tasks; only `runtime-clock.ts` touches wall time on
task/schedule paths.

## Invariants (the end state must read as designed today)

1. **Terminal ⇒ quiescent ⇒ reapable.** One terminal per turn, emitted at one exit, inside a
   try/finally (a thrown turn still terminates — today `Session.dispatchTurn` hangs waiters).
2. **No hard kill.** Only `task_stop`, interrupt, or scope close abort work. Interrupt
   escalates SIGTERM → SIGKILL after a grace period so the `interrupted` terminal is never
   blocked by a stubborn child.
3. **Settlements live only in TaskManager's pull FIFO.** Never in pi's steer/followUp queues
   (they revive terminated runs — confirmed agent-loop.js:154/157). Delivery = loop-owned
   re-prompt passes, batched; mid-run steer is best-effort and gated on no captured control
   result. Internal passes assert pi queues empty at start and are marked continuations
   (router `noteTurnStart` must not fire).
4. **Control tools are sequential and asserted.** `ask_user_question`,
   `select_state_machine_state`, `create_state_machine_definition` get
   `executionMode: "sequential"`; control capture is an asserting queue, never
   last-writer-wins. **Admin lane:** control tools and `task_output`/`task_stop` are pi tool
   calls but never create task descriptors (self-observation hazard).
5. **One subagent constructor, one task shape, one wording source.** SubagentSpec is the
   internal superset; the public spawn_agent schema is a restricted builder (no model/
   system_prompt in v1).
6. **Structured concurrency.** Every task has an owner scope; scope close cascade-stops
   descendants (children incl. memory scratch). Depth 2; descope valve = config clamp to 1.
7. **Test knobs don't ship.** Clock injection, floor overrides, short budgets are
   dependency-injected; a test asserts production defaults (120s budget, 15-min floor) intact.
8. **Vendored pi is read-only**; slice 01's contract tests double as an upgrade tripwire.
   Stay on 0.79.10 (ledger #14). Guardrails firewall stays dead (LM-G1 deferred).

## Standing verification gates

- Every slice: `bun run check-types && bun run lint && bun run test`; live evals
  docker-gated per repo convention. New evals follow write-eval red/green **plus a recorded
  falsification** (break the behavior, prove red, restore).
- Slice 13 (TUI) has a visual surface: run an unprimed
  [screenshot-critique](../../.claude/skills/screenshot-critique/SKILL.md) as the last check
  on its shots before acceptance.
- "Turn completed" alone is never an acceptance assertion — combine event order, task ids,
  sentinels, and negative assertions (fallback routes closed).

## Open items / product calls recorded

- Ledger #15 OPEN: does spawn_agent eventually subsume state-machine agent states?
- TUI follow-up-queue editor cannot see pending settlements (they bypass that queue by
  design). Slice 13 shows settlements read-only in that surface or records the deliberate
  omission.
- Heartbeat events are droppable/coalescing under backpressure; task + terminal events are
  lossless and ordered (slice 12).
